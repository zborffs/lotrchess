# Lord of the Rings: Chess
This is a Lord of the Rings-themed chess game made using SFML

## Art Contributions
Thank you to Erica Hanania for making the board and piece sprites.

## Source Dependencies
The project uses [conan](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/introduction.html) to handle all the source dependencies. The 
code relies on the following libraries:
  1. boost.process ~ talking to the uci engine using pipes
  2. SFML+ImGui ~ Graphics + UI components
  3. spdlog ~ logging back to the programmer
